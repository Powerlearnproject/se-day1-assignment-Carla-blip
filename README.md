#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools in the development and maintenance of high-quality software syatems. It involves design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
Its importance in the technology industry is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages like Fortan, C
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g. requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. It is a better method when a project must meet strict regulations as it requires deliverables for each phase before proceeding to the next one.
Agile methodology involves iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. It is better suited for teams that plan on moving fast, experimenting with direction and don't know how the final project will look before they start.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse
Version Control Systems (VCS)- These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include:
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
  Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It is important in that it helps avoid asking a vague question and getting confusing answers, by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is 'Tell me about cats'. 
A clear, specific and concise prompt is 'Tell me about the history of domestic cats'. 
When you use a vague prompt the AI might give a general answer but an improved prompt will ensure that you'll get a more focused response.
